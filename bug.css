The following CSS code has an uncommon error that leads to unexpected behavior.  The `box-shadow` property is applied incorrectly, causing the shadow to be larger than intended or in a wrong direction.

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```
