The following CSS code corrects the `box-shadow` property, ensuring the shadow is correctly sized and positioned:

```css
.element {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Corrected values */
}
```

The changes made are as follows:

*   **Reduced offset:** The `10px 10px` offset is changed to `5px 5px` resulting in a smaller shadow offset from the element.
*   **Reduced blur radius:** The `20px` blur radius is changed to `10px`, leading to less blurring of the shadow for crisper edges.
*   **Adjusted color opacity:** The opacity is lowered slightly (from 0.5 to 0.3).  This makes the shadow less intense and more subtle, often improving visual appeal.

Understanding the parameters of the `box-shadow` property (horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius, and color) is key to achieving the desired visual effect.
